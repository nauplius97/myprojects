## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
raw_data_file <- 'http://ecology.msu.montana.edu/labdsv/R/labs/lab1/bryceveg.R' # relative to where the .Rmd file is!
data <- read.table(raw_data_file,header=TRUE,row.names=1)
head(data)
```
</details>
<br />

#### :computer: Add code to do some analysis and plots of the data
<details markdown="1">
<summary>:key: Click to see hints</summary>
* Insert chunks with some relevant code, e.g.:

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
# to get number of presences for each species.
# Note that the first part of the function
# call (veg>0) evaluates to TRUE/FALSE or 1/0),
# and it is the sum of ones and zeros that
# gets calculated.
#spc_pres<-apply(veg>0,2,sum)

# to see a plot of the cumulative empirical density
# function (CEDF) for species presences
plot(data$taroff)
```

#### :computer: Make git ignore html output from R notebooks, and commit the notebook
The html output files are big and generated automatically when the notebook file is saved, so it's not necessary to have it in the repository
<details markdown="1">
<summary>:key: Click to see hints</summary>
* Add `*.nb.html` to .gitignore
* Decide if you want to add and commit the dataset file to the repository, or not
* Commit and push
* _You might have noticed that there is support for git in RStudio â€“ check this out and play around with it_

### Extra

#### :computer: Break out some code and put it in a separate .R file in an appropriate place

#### :computer: Call the external code from the notebook
